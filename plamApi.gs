We built Project IDX to simplify and streamline the developer workflow, aiming to reduce the sea of complexities traditionally associated with app development. It certainly seems like we've piqued your interest, and we love seeing what IDX has helped you build.\n\nFor example, we recently learned about Tanaki, an AI-enhanced content creation app built using Project IDX:\n\n\n\nPasquale D’Silva one of the developers that built Tanaki, said:\n\n\"Using the IDX shared workspace to build Tanaki has been so fun. It allows our remote team of imagineers to build together in one place. It is a magic collaboration portal!\"\n\nDevelopers at Google have also been using IDX internally to help speed up development across various projects. One example is the the Firebase Blog, where the full authoring, development, and deployment of the Astro-powered project is handled using IDX:\n\n\n\nAnother interesting project leveraging IDX’s extensibility model is Malloy, a new open-source data language available as a VS Code extension that operates against databases like BigQuery:\n\n\n\n\nLloyd Tabb, a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google, told us:\n\n“I use IDX with the Malloy project. I often have several different data projects going simultaneously and IDX lets me quickly spin up an instance to solve a problem and it is trivial to configure.\"\n\nIf you want to share what IDX has helped you build, use the #ProjectIDX tag on X.\n\nWhat’s new in IDX?\n\nIn addition to seeing how you’re using IDX, a key part of building Project IDX is your feedback, so we’ve continued to roll out features for you to test. We're excited to share the latest updates we've implemented to expedite and streamline multiplatform app development, so you can deliver with speed, ease and quality.\n \nPreview your app directly in IDX with our iOS simulator and Android emulator\n\nWe’re bringing the iOS Simulator and Android Emulator to the browser. Whether you’re building a Flutter or web app, Project IDX now allows you to preview your applications without having to leave your workspace. When you use a Flutter or web template, Project IDX intelligently loads the right preview environment for your application — Safari mobile and Chrome for web templates, or Android, iOS, and Chrome for Flutter templates. \n\n\n\nIDX’s web and Android emulators allow you to develop, test, and debug directly from your workspace, consolidating your multi-step, multiplatform process into one place. With iOS simulation you can spot-check your app's layout and behavior while you work. This feature is still experimental, so be sure to test it out and send us feedback. \n\nGet started fast with a rich library of project templates\n\nFour of our top ten feature requests have been to support more templates, so we’re pleased to share that we’ve added new templates for Astro, Go, Python/Flask, Qwik, Lit, Preact, Solid.js, and Node.js. Use these templates to jump right into your project so you can spend less time setting up and more time creating. \n\nCheck out our new and improved template gallery\n\nOf course you can still import your own repo from GitHub, directly from your local files, or you can choose your own setup using a custom Nix environment.\n\nQuickly build and customize your IDX workspace with improvements to Nix \n\n\n\nIDX uses Nix to define the environment configuration for each workspace to give you flexibility and extensibility in IDX – even our templates and previews are configured using Nix to ensure they’re working correctly inside IDX. We’re continuously working on Nix improvements to help boost your productivity, so now you can:\n\nCustomize IDX starter templates easily by leveraging Nix extensibility.\n\nReduce the likelihood of errors and write code more efficiently with Nix file editing, including support for syntax highlighting, error detection, and suggested code completions.\n\nRecover from broken configurations quickly and avoid unnecessary rebuild attempts with major improvements to our environment customization workflow, including seamless environment rebuilds and troubleshooting.\n\n\nEasily build, test, and deploy apps with additional new IDX features and resources\n\n\n\n\nAuto-detect network ports needed for applications or services and adjust the firewall settings to permit ingress and egress without any additional configuration on your end.\n\nInstantly run command-line tools, scripts, and utilities directly within workspace without the need to install them locally on your machine. \n\nSimplify the process of working with Docker containers and images directly from the development environment by enabling Docker in your dev.nix file.\n\n\n\nAI launched in 15 new regions\n\n\n\nWe’ve launched our AI capabilities in the following 15 countries: India, Australia, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Singapore, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. More countries will be enabled with AI access soon – indicate your interest for AI expansion in this feature tracking post and stay tuned for more AI updates.\n\nImproving together \n\nWe're constantly working on adding new capabilities to help you do higher quality work, more efficiently, with less friction. We’ve addressed dozens of your feature requests and fixed a multitude of bugs you flagged for us, so thank you for your continued support and engagement – please keep the feedback coming by filing bugs and feature requests.\n\nFor walkthroughs and more information on all the features mentioned above, check out our documentation page. If you haven’t already, visit our website to sign up to try Project IDX and join us on our journey.

Bazel is Google's open source build system for fast and correct builds. It has built-in support for building both client and server software, including client applications for both Android and iOS platforms. It also provides an extensible framework that you can use to develop your own build rules. Bazel builds almost all Google products, including Google Search, GMail, and Google Docs.What’s new in Bazel 7?Bazel 7 is the latest major release on the long-term support (LTS) track. It includes:Bzlmod: Bzlmod, Bazel's new modular external dependency management system, is now enabled by default (i.e. --enable_bzlmod defaults to true). If your project doesn't have a MODULE.bazel file, Bazel will create an empty one for you. The old WORKSPACE mechanism will continue to work alongside the new Bzlmod-managed system. Learn more about what’s changed since Bazel 6 and what’s coming up in Bazel 8 and 9.Build without the Bytes (BwoB): Build without the Bytes for builds using remote execution is now enabled by default (i.e. --remote_download_outputs defaults to toplevel). Bazel will no longer try to download any intermediate outputs from the remote server, but only the outputs of requested top-level targets instead. This significantly improves remote build performance. Learn more about BwoB.Merged analysis and execution (Skymeld): Project Skymeld aims to improve multi-target build performance by removing the boundary between the analysis and execution phases and allowing targets to be independently executed as soon as their analysis finishes.Platform-based toolchain resolution for Android and C++: This change helps streamline the toolchain resolution API across all rulesets, obviating the need for language-specific flags. It also removes technical debt by having Android and C++ rules use the same toolchain resolution logic as other rulesets. Full details for Android developers are available in the Android Platforms announcement.What's next?Read the full release notes for Bazel 7, and follow along as we work together towards Bazel 8:Bazel blogGitHubMailing listSlackX (formerly known as Twitter)If you have any questions or feedback, or would like to share something you’ve built, reach out to product@bazel.build.

Yet, a closer look at the AI startup ecosystem reveals a stark gender disparity. Women, despite their profound capabilities and innovative prowess, often find themselves navigating a maze of obstacles in their entrepreneurial journey. Despite investment in AI software is booming globally, the venture capital funding problem for women is even more marked. Women-founded startups accounted for only 2.1% of VC deals involving AI startups1. This is a reality that demands attention and action. Globally in 2023, all-women founding teams raised just 3% of all dollars invested in the year, with mixed gender founding teams taking 15%, leaving 82% of dollars to flow to founding teams that are all men2.Google's accelerator programs have actively taken a leading role in championing diversity and empowering women and minority founders - having supported 1100+ startups across the globe since 2016, 36% of which are women-led startups. As such, we are pleased to announce the launch of the Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program (Europe & Israel), a 12 week program for Seed to Series A AI startups based in Europe and Israel.The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program (Europe & Israel) provides a comprehensive mix of mentorship, technical support, and workshops, establishing a robust foundation for participants. Beyond Google's expert guidance, the accelerator cultivates a collaborative network among women founders, propelling innovation within the tech startup space. By empowering women founders, the Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program (Europe & Israel) proactively contributes to creating a more inclusive and equitable tech community.Applications for the Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders Europe & Israel program are open until January 19th, 2024. You can learn more and apply here.In a similar vein, in North America, two other Google for Startups Accelerator programs for underrepresented founders have opened applications for the fifth Women Founders and Black Founders programs. These 10 week equity- free programs are best suited for Seed to Series A, high potential revenue generative women-led and black-led startups with growing teams (5+ employees). Applications for both programs close on February 1st, 2024.To further explore these opportunities and why you should apply - listen to what past participants of the North American Women Founder and Black Founder programs have to say here.\noutput: 【Google 為女性創業家推出新加速器計劃】\n\n* Google for Startups Accelerator：女性創業家計劃 (歐洲和以色列) 為種子到 A 輪階段的人工智慧新創公司提供 12 周的培訓，包括輔導、技術支援和工作坊。\n* 計劃申請至 2024 年 1 月 19 日截止，更多資訊和申請連結請見官網。\n* 在北美，Google for Startups Accelerator 為少數族群創業家提供第五屆女性創業家和黑人創業家計劃，為期 10 週，無需投資，最適合種子輪到 A 輪階段、潛在營收高、團隊成長中 (超過 5 名員工) 的女性領導或黑人領導新創公司。\n* 兩項計劃都將於 2024 年 2 月 1 日截止申請，更多資訊和申請連結請見官網。\n* 也可以聽取北美女性創業家和黑人創業家計劃過去學員的分享，了解申請的理由和機會。\n\n#GoogleAccelerator #女性創業家 #少數族群創業家\n\ninput: Let’s try an experiment. We’ll show this picture to our multimodal model Gemini and ask it to describe what it sees:Tell me what you seeGemini:  I see a person's right hand. The hand is open with the fingers spread apart.Ok, let’s try this one:Gemini: A person knocking on a wooden door.How about this one?Gemini: I see a hand with two fingers extended, which is a common symbol for the number two.But wait … what if we asked Gemini to reason about all of these images together?What do you think I'm doing? Hint: it's a game.Gemini: You're playing rock, paper, scissors.Nice. What else could we try? Let's see if Gemini can notice this pattern:I’m playing rock paper scissors. Do you notice a pattern in my gameplay?Gemini: You are alternating between rock and scissors.Neat, it spotted the pattern! But does Gemini really know how this game works? Let’s try asking:Hmm ... do you think it's a good strategy?Gemini: No, it is not a good strategy. Your opponent will quickly learn your pattern and will be able to win every time. You should try to randomize your choices more.Good advice, Gemini! Okay, for this last one, let’s put your multimodal reasoning capabilities to the test. Here’s your prompt:This is a secret message. What does it say?Can you figure it out? We have gotten Gemini to solve it, but we won’t spoil it by putting the answer in this post. 🙂What is multimodal prompting?Everything we did just now is an example of “multimodal prompting.” We’re basically giving Gemini combinations of different modalities — image and text in this case — and having Gemini respond by predicting what might come next. Gemini’s ability to seamlessly combine these modes together enables new possibilities for what you can do.In this post, we’ll explore some of the prompting approaches we used in our Hands on with Gemini demo video. We’ll soon be rolling out Gemini for people to try in Google AI Studio, our free, web-based developer tool where you’ll be able to try your own multimodal prompts with Gemini. We’re hoping this guide of starter prompts and ideas helps inspire you to start exploring your own ideas.🧮 Spatial reasoning and logicLogic and puzzles are fun way to test Gemini. Let’s try one that requires both left-to-right spatial reasoning and knowledge about our solar system:Is this the right order? Consider the distance from the sun and explain your reasoning.Gemini: No, the correct order is Sun, Earth, Saturn. The Sun is the closest to the center of the solar system, followed by the Earth, and then Saturn.Nice! Here’s another, inspired by pinewood derby challenges:Which of these cars is more aerodynamic? The one on the left or the right? Explain why, using specific visual details.Gemini: The car on the right is more aerodynamic. It has a lower profile and a more streamlined shape. The car on the left has a higher profile and a more boxy shape, which makes it less aerodynamic.📷 Image sequencesNext, what if we showed Gemini a sequence of images? Let’s see we can show a few still frames from a game of charades and have Gemini guess the movie:Guess what movie I'm acting out.Gemini: The MatrixNice! But which part specifically? Look at my body movements.Gemini: The part where Neo dodges bullets.🪄 Magic tricksExploring image sequences really lets you dig into how Gemini reasons over time. Let’s try a classic magic trick.Explain what I'm doing.Gemini: You are holding a coin in your right hand.Where do you think the coin is?Gemini: The coin is in your right hand.Sure, that’s a logical answer given what it’s seen. But let’s pull a sleight of hand as we reveal this next image to Gemini...Look here, what happened?Gemini: The coin is gone.Gemini notices it’s gone. But can it summarize what may have happened?Summarize what may have happened, step by step, starting with the first image.Gemini: 1. You started with a coin in your right hand.2. You then made a motion with your hands, and the coin disappeared.3. You then showed that the coin was gone.Gemini is leveraging the entire context of this conversation – both text and image – to summarize its answer. Finally, let’s ask:Can you explain how it disappeared?Gemini: The coin was palmed.Gemini makes a really solid guess! But we won’t reveal our secret 🙂.🔀 Cup shufflingLet’s try a trick that requires memory and logic: the classic ball and cup shuffling game. For this one, we’ll break it down into steps for Gemini. First, let’s establish the basics with these instructions:Instructions: There are three cups in position 1 (left), position 2 (middle), position 3 (right).Next, we’ll need to tell Gemini where we’re placing the ball:Starting position: The ball is in position 3.Current state: empty, empty, ballNotice how we came up with a simple format for remembering where the ball is with “empty, empty, ball.” Next, let’s show Gemini two example turns:Images: Swap: 2 and 3Current state: empty, ball, emptyImages: Swap: 1 and 2Current state: ball, empty, emptyIn these two example turns, we’re both showing it what a swap looks like, and how to update the ball position. Now, let’s see if Gemini can generalize to a swap it hasn't seen:Images: Swap: Here's Gemini's response:1 and 3Current state: empty, empty, ballGemini got it! It looked at these images and correctly inferred that cups 1 and 3 are being swapped. And it reasoned correctly about how to update the ball position. Let’s ask:Tell me where the ball is and summarize how it got there, in paragraph form.Gemini: The ball is in cup 3. Starting with the ball in cup 3, the first swap was cup 2 and 3. This put the ball in cup 2. The second swap was cup 1 and 2. This put the ball in cup 1. The third swap was cup 1 and 3. This put the ball in cup 3.Not only did Gemini get the answer correctly, it accurately summarized the game history. Of course, it won’t always get this challenge right. Sometimes the fake out move (where you swap two empty cups) seems to trip it up, but sometimes it gets that too. But simple prompts like this make it really fun to rapidly test Gemini. You can change the variables in your prompt, including the order of swaps, and see how it does.🔨 Tool useIf you want to use Gemini in your own apps, you’ll want it to be able to connect to other tools. Let’s try a simple idea where Gemini needs to combine multimodality with tool use: drawing a picture to search for music.Step 1. Look at this drawing, describe everything in it, and come up with a fun, specific idea for a good musical soundtrack genre, mood, or soundtrack. Step 2. Provide a search query in the form: \"Search [insert query]\"Gemini: The drawing is of a guitar, drums, and an amplifier. There is also a palm tree. The mood is fun, upbeat, and tropical. The genre is reggae. The soundtrack could be used for a movie or TV show set in a tropical location. Search \"Reggae music for a tropical vacation\"Nice! Gemini both reasons about what it sees and then generates a search query you can parse to do a search. It’s like Gemini is acting like a translator for you – but instead of translating between languages, it’s translating modalities – from drawing to music in this case. With multimodal prompting, you can use Gemini to invent your own entirely new translations between different inputs and outputs.🕹️Game creationWhat if we tried using Gemini to quickly prototype a multimodal game? Here’s an idea: a geography guessing game where you have to point at a map to make your guess. Let’s start by prompting Gemini with the core idea:Instructions: Let's play a game. Think of a country and give me a clue. The clue must be specific enough that there is only one correct country. I will try pointing at the country on a map.Next, let’s give Gemini an example turn of gameplay, showing it how we want it to handle both incorrect and correct answers:Country: This country is huge island that is mostly covered in ice.(Answer: Greenland) Guess:I am pointing at the country of Canada *incorrect*Guess:I am pointing at the country of Greenland *correct*Let’s give it a go and prompt Gemini to generate a clue:Clue:This country is known for its unique wildlife, including kangaroos and koalas. (Answer: Australia)Ok, that’s a good clue. Let’s test out whether pointing will work. Just for fun, let’s try pointing at the wrong place first:Guess:I am pointing at the country of Brazil *incorrect*Great! Gemini looked at my image and figured out I’m pointing at Brazil, and correctly reasoned that’s wrong. Now let’s point at the right place on the map:I am pointing at the country of Australia *correct*Nice! We’ve basically taught Gemini our game logic just by giving it an example. You'll also notice that it generalized from the illustrated hand in the examples.⌨️ CodingOf course, to bring your game idea to life, you’ll eventually have to write some executable code. Let’s see if Gemini can make a simple countdown timer for a game, but with a few fun twists:Implement a simple timer in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Use a sans serif font and dark mode. Start it at 10 seconds and start counting down. When it reaches zero, replace the timer with a random emoji that is associated with excitement and motivation! Then go back to the timer at 10 seconds and start counting down again.With just this single instruction, Gemini gives us a working timer that does what we asked for:My favorite part is scrolling through Gemini’s source code to find the array of motivational emojis it picked for me: const emojis  = ['🚀', '⚡️', '🎉', '🎊', '🥳', '🤩', '✨'];\n👀 A sneak peekThroughout this post, we’ve been giving Gemini an input, and having Gemini make predictions for what might come next. That's basically what prompting is. And our inputs have been multimodal – image and text, combined.But so far we've only shown Gemini responding in text. Maybe you’re wondering, can Gemini also respond with a combination of image and text? It can! This is a capability of Gemini called “interleaved text and image generation.” While this feature won’t be ready in the first version of Gemini for people to try, we hope to roll it out soon. Here’s a sneak peek of what’s possible.Let’s see if we could use Gemini to provide everyday creative inspiration. And let’s try it in a domain that requires a bit of multimodal reasoning ... knitting! 🧶. Similar to our map game above, let's provide one example turn of interaction:Give me three ideas for crochet creations I could make with these two colors:Colors: I see blue and yellow yarn.Idea 1: How about a cute dog with one yellow ear? Image 1:Idea 2: Or how about a jellyfish with a few yellow tentacles?Image 2:Idea 3: Or how about a blue cat with a yellow nose?Image 3:We’re essentially teaching Gemini about how we want each interaction to go: “I’ll take a photo of two balls of yarn, and I expect you (Gemini) to both come up with an idea for something I could make, and generate an image of it.”Now, let’s show it a new pair of yarn colors it hasn't yet seen, and see if it can generalize:Give me three ideas for crochet creations I could make with these two colors:Gemini:Colors: I see blue and pink yarn.Idea 1: How about a pig with blue ears?Image 1:Idea 2: Or an octopus with pink and blue tentacles?Image 2:Idea 3: Or a bunny with a pink nose?Image 3:Nice! Gemini correctly reasoned about the new colors (“I see blue and pink yarn”) and generated these ideas and the images in a single, interleaved output of text and image.What Gemini did here is fundamentally different from today’s text-to-image models. It's not just passing an instruction to a separate text-to-image model. It sees the image of my actual yarn on my wooden table, truly doing multimodal reasoning about my text and image together.What's Next?We hope you found this a helpful starter guide to get a sense of what’s possible with Gemini. We’re very excited to roll it out to more people soon so you can explore your own ideas through prompting. Stay tuned!\noutput: 【以多模式提示探索 Gemini 的無限可能】\n\n多模式提示是一種將圖像和文字等不同模態組合起來，並讓 Gemini 預測接下來可能發生什麼的技術。Gemini 能夠將這些模式無縫組合在一起，為您帶來全新的可能性。\n\nGemini 具有多種有趣的功能，例如：\n\n* 空間推理和邏輯：Gemini 可以回答邏輯和智力謎語，並在圖像序列中識別模式。\n* 圖像序列：Gemini 可以理解一系列圖像，並猜測發生了什麼。\n* 魔術把戲：Gemini 可以解釋魔術把戲，並猜測魔術師是如何做到的。\n* 杯子戲法：Gemini 可以玩杯子戲法，並通過交換杯子來移動球的位置。\n* 工具使用：Gemini 可以連接到其他工具，例如將圖畫轉換為音樂搜索查詢。\n* 遊戲創作：Gemini 可以幫助您快速創建多模式遊戲的原型。\n* 編碼：Gemini 可以生成簡單的倒數計時器代碼，並在計時器歸零時顯示隨機表情符號。\n\n除了以文字回應之外，Gemini 也可以使用圖像和文字交錯生成的技術來回應。這種技術可以讓 Gemini 生成圖像和文字交錯的輸出，例如根據您提供的毛線照片，為您提供編織創作的點子和圖像。\n\n我們希望這個指南能幫助您了解使用 Gemini 的可能性。我們很期待在不久的將來向更多人開放 Gemini，讓您能夠通過提示來探索自己的想法。敬請期待！\n\n#Gemini  #多模式提示  #AI  #圖像和文字  #提示  #開發\n\ninput: Developer Journey is a monthly series highlighting diverse and global developers sharing relatable challenges, opportunities, and wins in their journey.

It’s available on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and as a web app with an extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.The opportunityMany users choose password managers because of the pain and frustration of dealing with passwords. While password managers help here, the fact remains that one of the biggest issues with passwords are security breaches. Passkeys on the other hand bring passwordless authentication with major advancements in security.Passkeys are a simple and secure authentication technology that enables signing in to online accounts without entering a password. They cannot be reused, don't leak in server breaches of relying parties, and protect users from phishing attacks. Passkeys are built on open standards and work on all major platforms and browsers.As an authentication tool, Dashlane’s primary goal is to ensure customers’ credentials are kept safe. They realized how significant the impact of passkeys could be to the security of their users and adapted their applications to support passkeys across devices, browsers, and platforms. With passkey support they provide users a secure and convenient access with a phishing-resistant authentication method.ImplementationPasskeys as a replacement for passwords is a relatively new concept and to address the challenge of going from a familiar to an unfamiliar way of logging in, the Dashlane team considered various solutions.On the desktop web they implemented conditional UI support through a browser extension to help users gracefully navigate the choice between using a password and a passkey to log into websites that support both login methods. As soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion dialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The user can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in.Note: To learn how to add passkeys support with conditional UI to your web app check out Create a passkey for passwordless logins and Sign in with a passkey through form autofill.On Android, they used the Credential Manager API which supports multiple sign-in methods, such as username and password, passkeys, and federated sign-in solutions (such as Sign-in with Google) in a single API. The Credential Manager simplifies the development process and it has enabled Dashlane to implement passkeys support on Android in 8 weeks with a team of one engineer.Note: If you are a credential provider, such as a password manager app, check out the guide on how to integrate Credential Manager with your credential provider solution.ResultsData shows that users are more satisfied with the passkey flows than the existing password flows.The conversion rate is 92% on passkey authentication opportunities on the web (when Dashlane suggests a saved passkey for the user to sign in), compared to a 54% conversion rate on opportunities to automatically sign in with passwords. That’s a 70% increase in conversion rate compared to passwords–a great sign for passkey adoption.The conversion rate here refers to user actions when they visit websites that support passkeys. If a user attempts to register or use a passkey they will see a Dashlane dialog appear on Chrome on desktop. If they proceed and create new or use an existing passkey it is considered a success. If they dismiss the dialog or cancel passkey creation, it’s considered a failure. The same user experience flow applies to passwords.Dashlane also saw a 63% conversion rate on passkey registration opportunities (when Dashlane offers to save a newly created passkey to the user’s vault) compared to only around 25% conversion rate on suggestions to save new passwords. This indicates that Dashlane’s suggestions to save passkeys are more relevant and precise than the suggestions to save passwords.Dashlane observed an acceleration of passkey usage with 6.8% average weekly growth of passkeys saved and used on the web.TakeawaysWhile passkeys are a new technology that users are just starting to get familiar with, the adoption rate and positive engagement rates show that Dashlane users are more satisfied with passkey flows than the existing password flows. “Staying up to date on developments in the market landscape and industry, anticipating the potential impact to your customers’ experience, and being ready to meet their needs can pay off. Thanks in part to our rapid implementation of the Credential Manager API, customers can rest assured that they can continue to rely on Dashlane to store and help them access services, no matter how authentication methods evolve.“ –Rew Islam, Director of Product Engineering and Innovation at Dashlane Dashlane tracks and investigates all passkey errors and says that there haven’t been many. They also receive few questions from customers around how to use or manage their passkeys. This can be a sign of an intuitive user experience, clear help center documentation, a tendency of passkey users today already being knowledgeable about passkeys, or some combination of these factors.AndroidBeginnercase studyLearnmobileprivacy\noutput: 【Dashlane：密碼金鑰提升使用者體驗】\n\nDashlane 是一個密碼管理工具，提供安全的方式來管理使用者憑證、訪問控制和跨多個系統和應用程式的身份驗證。Dashlane 在 180 個國家擁有超過 1800 萬使用者和 20,000 家企業。它可在 Android、iOS、macOS、Windows 上使用，並作為 Web 應用程式，並提供 Chrome、Firefox、Edge 和 Safari 的擴充套件。\n\nDashlane 實現了密碼金鑰支援，為使用者提供安全便捷的訪問，以及防釣魚的身份驗證方法。\n\n結果顯示，與現有的密碼流程相比，使用者對密碼金鑰流程更滿意。\n\n網頁上的密碼金鑰身份驗證機會的轉換率為 92%（當 Dashlane 建議使用者使用儲存的密碼金鑰登錄時），而使用密碼自動登錄的機會的轉換率為 54%。與密碼相比，轉換率提高了 70%——這是密碼金鑰採用的好兆頭。\n\nDashlane 還發現，密碼金鑰註冊機會的轉換率為 63%（當 Dashlane 建議將新建立的密碼金鑰儲存到使用者的保險庫中時），而建議儲存新密碼的轉換率僅為 25% 左右。這表明 Dashlane 儲存密碼金鑰的建議比儲存密碼的建議更相關、更精確。\n\nDashlane 觀察到密碼金鑰使用量的加速，網頁上儲存和使用的密碼金鑰平均每週增長 6.8%。\n\n#密碼金鑰 #使用者體驗 #安全 #Dashlane #身份驗證\n\ninput: Attackers are taking greater strides to evade detection. This is one of the running themes in our latest release: M-Trends 2024. This edition of our annual report continues our tradition of providing relevant attacker and defender metrics, and insights into the latest attacker tactics, techniques and procedures, along with guidance and best practices on how organizations and defenders should be responding to threats.\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThis year’s M-Trends report covers Mandiant Consulting investigations of targeted attack activity conducted between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. During that time, many of our observations demonstrate a more concerted effort by attackers to evade detection, and remain undetected on systems for longer periods of time:\n\n\nIncreased targeting of edge devices, and platforms that traditionally lack endpoint detection and response solutions.\n\n\nA more than 50% growth in zero-day usage over the same reporting period in 2022, both by espionage groups as well as financially-motivated attackers.\n\n\nMore “living off the land,” or use of legitimate, pre-installed tools and software within an environment.\n\n\nDespite the increased focus on evasion by attackers, we are pleased to report that defenders are generally continuing to improve at detecting threats. Dwell time represents the period an attacker is on a system from compromise to detection, and in 2023 the global median dwell time is now 10 days, down from 16 days in 2022. While various factors (such as ransomware) help drive down dwell time, it’s still a big win for defenders. We can’t let up, however. Mandiant red teams need only five to seven days on average to achieve their objectives, so organizations must remain vigilant. Other M-Trends 2024 metrics include:\n\n\n54% of organizations first learned of a compromise from an external source (down from 63% in 2022), while 46% first identified evidence of a compromise internally.\n\n\nOur engagements most frequently occurred at financial services organizations (17.3%), business and professional services (13.3%), high tech (12.4%), retail and hospitality (8.6%), healthcare (8.1%), and government (8.1%).\n\n\nThe most common initial infection vectors were exploits (38%), phishing (17%), prior compromise (15%), and stolen credentials (10%). \n\n\nAdditional topics covered in detail in M-Trends 2024 include Chinese espionage operations targeting the visibility gap, the evolution of phishing amid shifting security controls, the use of adversary-in-the-middle to overcome multi-factor authentication, cloud intrusion trends, and the role of artificial intelligence in red and purple team engagements. \nWith the release of M-Trends 2024, we hope to arm security professionals with insights from the frontlines of the latest, constantly evolving cyber attacks, and to provide actionable learnings to improve organizations’ security postures.\nRead M-Trends 2024 now, and register today for our webinar series to get a closer look from experts about the data and insights in this year’s report. M-Trends 2024: Executive Edition is also available to read now, featuring a high-level overview of each section, along with key takeaways.\noutput: 【M-Trends 2024：攻擊者逃避偵測趨勢】\n\nMandiant Consulting 發佈了 M-Trends 2024 報告，揭示了攻擊者逃避偵測的最新趨勢。報告涵蓋了 2023 年針對性攻擊活動的調查結果，發現攻擊者更加努力地逃避偵測，並在系統中停留更長時間。\n\n主要發現：\n\n* 攻擊者越來越多地針對邊緣設備和傳統上缺乏端點偵測和響應解決方案的平台。\n* 與 2022 年同期相比，零日漏洞的使用量增長了 50% 以上。\n* 攻擊者更多地使用「就地取材」技術，即利用環境中合法的預安裝工具和軟體。\n\n儘管攻擊者越來越注重逃避偵測，但報告顯示，防禦者在偵測威脅方面總體上仍在不斷改進。2023 年全球平均停留時間為 10 天，低於 2022 年的 16 天。\n\n其他重要指標：\n\n* 54% 的組織首先從外部來源得知入侵事件。\n* 金融服務組織 (17.3%) 是最常受到攻擊的目標。\n* 最常見的初始感染途徑是漏洞利用 (38%) 和網路釣魚 (17%)。\n\n報告還深入探討了其他主題，包括中國間諜活動、網路釣魚的演變、雲端入侵趨勢以及人工智慧在紅隊和紫隊參與中的作用。\n\n#M-Trends #網路安全 #攻擊者 #防禦者 #威脅情報\n\ninput: The content in this blog post was originally published last week as a members-only email to the Google Cloud Innovators community.

This feature enables your Cloud Run resources to send traffic directly to a VPC network without proxying it through Serverless VPC Access connectors, making it easier to set up, faster, and with lower costs.\nIn fact, Direct VPC egress delivers approximately twice the throughput compared to both VPC connectors and the default Cloud Run internet egress path, offering up to 1 GB per second per instance. Whether you're sending traffic to destinations on the VPC, to other Google Cloud services like Cloud Storage, or to other destinations on the public internet, Direct VPC egress offers higher throughput and lower latency for performance-sensitive apps.\nWhat's new since the preview\nNotable improvements and new features:\n\n\nAll regions where Cloud Run is available are now enabled for Direct VPC egress.\n\n\nEach Cloud Run service revision with Direct VPC can now scale beyond 100 instances as controlled by a quota. There is a standard quota increase request process if you need to scale even more. \n\n\nCloud NAT is supported, and Direct VPC egress traffic is now included in VPC Flow Logs and Firewall Rules Logging.\n\n\nThese updates address the top issues reported by our preview customers, especially larger customers with advanced scalability, networking, and security requirements. \nCustomer feedback\nMany customers have been trying Direct VPC egress in preview since last year and have given us great feedback, including DZ BANK:\n\"With Direct VPC egress for Cloud Run, the platform team can more easily onboard new Cloud Run workloads because we no longer need to maintain Serverless VPC Access connectors and their associated dedicated /28 subnets. In our dynamic environment, where new Cloud Run services are created regularly, this simpler networking architecture saves us 4-6 hours per week of manual toil. We have also deprovisioned 30+ VPC connectors, saving on the additional compute costs for running them.\" - Tim Harpe, Senior Cloud Engineer, DZ BANK\nIf you enable direct VPC egress and send all your egress traffic to a VPC, you can leverage the same tools and capabilities for all your traffic – from Cloud Run, GKE, or VMs.\nNext steps\nDirect VPC egress is ready for your production workloads. Try it today and enjoy better performance and lower cost.\nFor a primer about how Direct VPC egress works, check out our preview blog post and its attached explainer video., pubDate=Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 GMT+08:00 2024, imageURL=null, link=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/direct-vpc-egress-for-cloud-run-is-now-ga/, title=Direct VPC egress on Cloud Run is now generally available,\noutput: 【Cloud Run 直接 VPC 出口正式上線】\n\nCloud Run 直接 VPC 出口功能現已正式上線，可讓 Cloud Run 資源直接將流量發送到 VPC 網路，無需透過無伺服器 VPC 訪問連接器進行代理，從而更易於設置、速度更快且成本更低。\n\n直接 VPC 出口與 VPC 連接器和預設 Cloud Run 互聯網出口路徑相比，吞吐量大約提高了一倍，每個實例每秒可達 1 GB。無論您是將流量發送到 VPC 上的目標位置、其他 Google Cloud 服務（如 Cloud Storage），還是公共互聯網上的其他目標位置，直接 VPC 出口都為性能敏感型應用程式提供更高的吞吐量和更低的延遲。\n\n#CloudRun #VPC #網路 #性能 #成本\n\ninput: "+content+"\noutput:"
